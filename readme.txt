# Bitcoin NO API Requried            #

I have been receiving a lot of reports that users are unable to obtain API Keys from Blockchain.info. 
So I have created this shopping cart that will allow users to accept bitcoin on their website without having to use a privileged API service. 
This project does use some public API's to check the blockchain but they require no permission or API Keys. 

This is a fork of a previous project, Blockchain Receive Payments API Shopping Cart (https://github.com/coinables/Blockchain-Receive-Payments-API-Shopping-Cart)

1. Download the files in the repository
2. Create and configure a database on your webserver (How to: http://www.fastcomet.com/tutorials/cpanel/create-database)
3. Import the included SQL database files using PHPmyadmin or similar database manager (How to: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9143/29/how-to-import-and-export-database-in-cpanel-access-denied-create-database-dbname-error-and-how-to-fix-it
4. Open the config.php file and update the fields

That's it!

Access the admin panel to manage your orders and products with login.php
The password to access the admin page is set in your config.php
